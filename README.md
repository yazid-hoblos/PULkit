# Versatile Toolkit for PUL Systems Detection

This repository offers a wide range of scripts developed within the scope of a project aimed at **PUL** (Polysaccharide Utilization Loci) systems detection at the pangenome level. It encompasses three main broad themes: 

<ol type="1" style="list-style: none;">
  <li> PUL models formulation</li>
  <li> Helper scripts for PUL systems detection and validation</li>
  <li> Comparartive analysis of predictions across approaches</li>
</ol>

## 1. PUL Models Formulation **`/pul_models/`** 

PUL prediction models remain currently limited to two main approaches in the literature:

1. The _SusCD_ model introduced by _Terrapon et al._ [[1]](#ref1) in 2015, formally defining PULs as operon-like structures centered around a SusC-SusD adjacent pair (TonB-dependent transporter). It primarily concerns _Bacteroidetes_ species as it was defined and validated on them.

2. To further generalize PUL systems definition, dbCAN2 [[2]](#ref2) introduced _CAZyme Gene Clusters (CGCs)_ in 2018 as clusters of at least one CAZyme, one transporter component (TC), and one transcription factor (TF), separated by a maximum of two non-signature genes.

Here, the potential of formulating specific PUL models in a more rigorous manner based on experimentally-validated PULs is explored, primarily on the basis of substrate-based classification. The main challenge remains the limited availability of curated PUL data. One potential way to circumvent this issue is making use of the predictions obtained based on more general models, such as the two highlighted. 

To this end, high-confidence predictions across diverse species and genera, preferably at the pangenome level, could be analyzed to reveal distinctive signature patterns. Adopting this approach within the context of a specific inquiry, e.g. PULs associated with a specific substrate (which could be predicted for unvalidated PULs), would increase the chances of uncovering insightful patterns to guide new models formulation. Thus, the suggested approach is bidirectional: current models are used to generate predictions, which guide the iterative refinement of the models. 

### 1.1. Exploring PUL Signature Patterns   
**`/pul_models/signature_patterns/`**

An initial attempt to explore patterns across heterogenous experimentally-validated PULs could be found in this directory, primarily focused on: 
- Component pattern analysis 
- Signature motifs within PULs
- Statistical patterns across PULs

A detailed description of the analysis that was done could be found in the directory's corresponding report: [README](pul_models/signature_patterns/README.md).

### 1.2. Curated PUL Data 
**`/pul_models/pul_data/`**

- Curated empirically-validated PUL systems
- _SusCD_ HMM profiles
- The scripts used for data accession and analysis are in [bin/](pul_models/bin/)

More details on the scripts are covered step-by-step in the README of **substrate-specific/**: [README](pul_models/substrate-specific/README.md).

### 1.3. Substrate-specific PUL Models 
**`/pul_models/substrate-specific/`**

- Models formultion for PULs associated to one substrate
- Curated data and initial findings for xylan PULs

More details in associated report: [README](pul_models/substrate-specific/README.md).
