The "draw_spot" option produces spot figures that illustrate the organization of systems in spots. It exclusively depicts 
organisms that possess at least one system. Furthermore, this option generates individual TSV files for each spot,
containing the names of the organisms that were drawn. <br>
The script was adapted from PPanGGOLiN's "draw_spot" functionality to incorporate new systems options within the 
figures it generates. Specifically, two new options have been introduced: "system_related" and "complete_system."
</div>
<br> 

## System related
<div style="text-align: justify">  
The "system_related" option displays gene families annotated as part of a system model, regardless of whether the system
is complete or not, in the organism that is being illustrated. 
</div>
<br>

## Complete system 
<div style="text-align: justify">  
On the other hand, the "complete_system" option displays gene families that are components of a complete system in the 
organism where the projection was carried out, with the projection process performed by the 
</div>

["Systems projection"](./system_asso_script.md#w_systems_proj) part.
